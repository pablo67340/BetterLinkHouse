Requires Atmosphere, Zelda with Update 1.6.0 & DLC

If DLC/Update is not installed, this will not work!

Installation:
1. Extract files onto root of SD card. Launch Game!


Known Bugs (To fix):
Currently there is 1 Bow display that is behind a sheld beside the front-door and it cannot be accessed.

Special thanks to banan039 for helping me with research, 
and creating the original base file that was used when porting to switch.
This mod wouldn't be possible without his information <3
